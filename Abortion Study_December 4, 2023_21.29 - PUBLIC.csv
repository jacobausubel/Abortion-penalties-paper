I would also like to see those in Washington work on either reducing housing costs or pushing for higher minimum wages, because both of these affect many families' (as well as single people's) ability to live. Finally, I would like to see elected leaders work together to keep the government running smoothly. As things stand now, Republicans seem to always be blocking Democrats' efforts to govern.

This should involve working towards a comprehensive healthcare system that ensures no one is left behind and focuses on preventive care, mental health support, and reducing healthcare disparities.

The second thing we need is someone who is really going to take a serious stab at lowering prices of everyday items for everyday people, because despite what the current administration is saying, inflation is not under any sort of control. Everything I have to buy just to survive, TP, toothpaste, etc. is still way overpriced and not coming down, and that goes for grocery prices as well, its a huge mess for the majority of people who live paycheck to paycheck, month to month. Lack of sufficient services for people in other states. I believe there are only two states out of 50 who provide welfare benefits for those in need. I know this is an unpopular subject  but the truth is when a person becomes disabled after having been a working and contributing member of society their whole life, it is going to take them possibly several years to get approved for SS/SSI or SSDI. It is not right. This is a close personal issue for me because I worked for 30 years before becoming seriously injured and now cannot work regular gainful work. I was lucky enough to live in a state that did provide welfare benefits. I am not stating that we should just let everyone have money no matter what but there are people who are really in need and nothing is being done about this 48 of 50 states. What happens to these people? Suicide? Depression? Anxiety? Feelings of shame and guilt and wondering what you could have done differently to avoid this? By the time you finally do get approved for the benefits you worked your whole life for, you are no longer the same person, you are an even much more broke version of yourself. I live in Minnesota and the GA benefit is 203 dollars, 30% of that goes to rent, and the rest is all you have to live on for a whole month. Thank god it is something, but you go without many things you really should have access to and it spirals you down into a really dark place. Many people where I live spiraled down into drugs because of it. I am fortunate that this is not my case but I see these things first hand everyday of what started as just an injury makes your life unrecognizable.

So yes, we need to start fixing the problems in our own country and that starts with helping people with very basic things so that the fabric of our society does not continue to disintegrate at an alarming pace because people know the truth, that no one in Washington actually gives a **** about them.

Growing the Economy: Growing the economy means creating more jobs and helping businesses thrive. Elected leaders can do this by making smart investments in things like infrastructure and education, which can lead to more opportunities for people and a stronger, more prosperous country.

Fighting Illegal Immigration: Leaders should also address illegal immigration by finding a fair and effective way to manage it. This means securing our borders and creating a system that encourages legal immigration while still respecting the rights and dignity of those seeking a better life in the United States.

Secondly, immigration and the status of only a handful of the United States' cities as sanctuary cities has led to many asylum seekers without shelter and basic resources. Housing needs to be built and/or created based on old structures to support immigrants seeking a better life. Housing correlates with the market and rising inflation, making it unaffordable for most Americans to purchase a home.

Promoting equality covers a large spectrum involving equality among all races, sexes, etc., as well as more financial equality. So many of the struggles and arguments and division in our country right now boil down to some kind of inequality, and by trying to lessen that inequality, I really think that many problems will be resolved. Lowering poverty rates is definitely tied in with promoting equality. Minimum wage needs to be higher and money needs to be spread within companies with more going to employees and less going to the CEOs, etc. And finally, stricter gun laws need to be enacted because with so much turmoil in the country from these issues with inequality and poverty, many people are acting out, and although they will still act out without guns, there would be many less deaths resulting from it.","No additional comments.","1024","misinformation","control","factcheck"

I'd also like to see political leaders do something to address polarization and how politics generally runs, but that will never happen because the steps they could probably take--changing campaign finance laws, etc--are not in their short term interest. Finally, I wish leaders would pass serious budgets. I'm not a fiscal policy hawk by any means, but I think it is pie in the sky to think we never have to pay attention to deficits or the long-term commitments we have already made. It seems that everyone agrees the debt can become an issue at some point, so let's have serious conversations about military spending, healthcare costs and the other major drivers of federal debt. The things we seem to fight about--social safety nets etc--are not what is causing the damage to our financial health. I know this is largely seen as a conservative position to even talk about debt. But it really isn't. The change in interest rates and the global environment have made the costs of debt more serious. The disfunction politically also makes the US look like less of a secure place to park money and those things *could* really have an impact.

And then of course there is Trump and the bat shit craziness that is the power center of the Republican party ;)","I found the study interesting. In particular the video that says ""1 in 5 women experience a complication."" It was nice to see in the fact check that the statistic was false or misleading. But these sorts of studies are really hard to take. I believe in following facts, not partisan agendas. I don't have a ""team"" and don't really understand why people would feel so strongly identified with one side or the other. I want good policy wherever it comes from.

Back to the stat though, I can imagine a world in which the 1 in 5 stat is literally true but gets twisted by these super pacs or lobbying groups or whatever they are. Like what kind of complications are we talking about? What gets defined ""as an abortion or not""? Sometimes there is just practical reality (I don't believe whatever special categorization you want to have makes the 10 year old terminating her pregnancy not an abortion) and I generally hear medication abortion is safe, but what those things mean statistically and whether you can put together talking points that are true in some sense to say ""1 in 5 women experience a complication"" is often another matter. There is a lack of intellectual honesty among many of these groups. They aren't trying to be objective or to craft good policy. They are trying to get what they want.","1020","misinformation","control","misinformation"
