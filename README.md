Data and code for "The Reputational Penalty: How Fact-Checking Can Penalize Those Who Spread Misinformation"

Note that Annika Davies, Ethan Porter, and I conducted three studies. In Study 1, we ran a single survey. In Study 2, we ran two survey waves and then merged together data for respondents who took both. In Study 3, we ran two completely separate surveys. In the first, we identified which political activists have higher and lower name recognition. In the second, we ran the main analysis in this study.

In this repository, I include our code and knitted PDFs. I also include public versions of our datasets in which personally identifiable information has been removed.
